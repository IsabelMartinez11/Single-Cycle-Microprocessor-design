# Single-Cycle-Microprocessor-design
This project involves designing and testing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as part of a single-cycle microprocessor. The ALU implements multiple arithmetic and logical operations and integrates structural modules for functionality testing and flag generation.
